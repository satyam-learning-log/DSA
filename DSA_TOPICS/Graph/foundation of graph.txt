Core concepts, algorithms, and techniques a beginner must learn for graphs (data structure), organized by priority and with brief why/how notes.
Foundations (must know)


Definitions and terminology
Vertex/node, edge, directed vs undirected, weighted vs unweighted, multigraph, simple graph, self-loop, degree, indegree/outdegree, path, cycle, connected component, strongly/weakly connected, bipartite graph, tree.


Representations
Adjacency list (space-efficient, common), adjacency matrix (O(1) edge check, dense graphs), edge list (useful for algorithms like Kruskal).

Basic traversal
Depth-first search (ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS): recursion/stack, discovery/finish times, use for connectivity, cycle detection, topological sort.
Breadth-first search (ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.BFS): shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order, queue-based.


Essential algorithms and patterns
Shortest paths
ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.BFS for unweighted graphs.

Dijkstra’s algorithm (non-negative weights): priority queue, relaxations, time complexity variations.

Bellman–Ford (graphs with negative edges; detects negative cycles).

Floyd–Warshall (all-pairs shortest paths; dynamic programming, O(n^3)).



Minimum spanning trees (for undirected weighted graphs):

Kruskal’s algorithm: sort edges, union-find (disjoint set) for cycle detection.
Prim’s algorithm: grow tree with min-heap, good for dense graphs with adjacency matrix.


Topological sort
Kahn’s algorithm (indegree queue) and ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS-based order; use for DAG scheduling.
Connectivity and components

Connected components (undirected): ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS/ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.BFS.
Strongly connected components (directed): Kosaraju’s, Tarjan’s (lowlink).


Cycle detection
Directed: ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS color/recursion stack method.
Undirected: ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS/ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.BFS with parent-tracking.


Bipartite checking
ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.BFS/ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS coloring (two-coloring), relation to odd-length cycles.
Matching (introductory)
Bipartite matching basics: Ford–Fulkerson, Hopcroft–Karp (faster).
Network flow (introductory)
Max flow: Edmonds–Karp (ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.BFS-based augmenting paths), Dinic’s (level graph), applications to matching and cuts.
Graph transformations and reductions
Converting problems into shortest paths, flow, MST, matching; modelling tips.


Important tooling & techniques
Complexity analysis
Time/space bounds for adjacency list vs matrix, per-edge/per-vertex amortized reasoning, priority queue costs.
Data structures used with graphs
Heaps/priority queues, union-find (with path compression & union by rank), stacks/queues, hash maps/sets.
Implementation patterns
Edge relaxation, visited sets, parent arrays, explicit stacks to avoid recursion limits, iterative ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS.
Correctness/debugging strategies
Small example tests, invariants (e.g., distances nonincreasing after relaxations), printing traversal orders, visualizing graphs.
Advanced/topics to encounter next
Planar graphs, graph embeddings.
Graph isomorphism (basic idea).
Spectral graph theory (Laplacian, eigenvalues) — basics for ML.
Random graphs, probabilistic properties.
Approximation and NP-hard problems on graphs: TSP, vertex cover, dominating set.
Dynamic graphs, streaming graphs, large-scale graph processing frameworks (Pregel, GraphX).
Learning path (practical sequence)
Learn representations and implement adjacency list/matrix.
Implement ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.BFS and ProblemsOnBFSAndDFS.DFS; practice on connectivity, shortest path (unweighted), cycle detection.
Study Dijkstra and Bellman–Ford; implement and compare on small examples.
Learn MST algorithms (Kruskal with union-find, Prim).
Implement topological sort and SCC algorithms (Kosaraju or Tarjan).
Study bipartite matching and basic max-flow (Edmonds–Karp), then Dinic and Hopcroft–Karp.
Solve progressive problems (coding practice) varying size/constraints to internalize complexity trade-offs.
Resources and practice tips
Visualizers: Visualgo, GraphTea, or interactive graph visualizers to see traversals.
Problem sets: start with standard problems (shortest path, MST, SCC, topological sort) on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank.
Implement by hand, then compare to library implementations. Time small examples on paper to master invariants.
Common pitfalls
Using adjacency matrix for large sparse graphs (memory/time waste).
Forgetting to mark visited or handle parent in undirected cycle detection.
Not handling negative weights appropriately (using Dijkstra with negatives).
Ignoring disconnected components in global algorithms.
This set gives a compact, practical roadmap: master representations and traversals first, then shortest paths/MST/flow/SCC, and practice varied problems to build intuition and implementation fluency.
